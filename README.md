# Epilogue
A 2D side-scroller game inspired by Contra, set in a post-apocalyptic Earth.

## Overview
Set in the far future, where humanity has perished, and now new breed of creatures roam this world anew, the game follows our monster protagonist, who lives deep underground, in its nest of veins, blood, and flesh. It is happy chewing down on creatures -- innocents or otherwise -- that roam down there. However, one day (that is the start of the game), it starts hearing a mysterious song, sung by a melodious humming voice. The entire game is just the creature journeying out of their cave, and into the equally crazy and maddening world to fight through and reach the singing voice. 

## Target Platforms
Windows, Linux, macOS, and maybe Android (if Godot releases the Android build template for C#)
